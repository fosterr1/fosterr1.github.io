<h2>HW0: Introduction</h2>
<p>I am from Hilton Head Island and am a third year Computer Science major at the College of Charleston.</p>
<h2>HW1: Chapter 1</h2>
<h3>1.3</h3>
<p>A software should have the attributes of acceptability, dependability and security, efficiency, and maintainability.  Other attributes that are beneficial to software are: compatibility to work on several different devices, scalability to be able to apply the functions of the software to a wide array of different things, portability to move the software and its data to another device, and upgradability to be able to update the software with new functions and fix bugs in an efficient manner.</p>
<h3>1.8</h3>
<p>The problem with licensing software engineers in the same way as doctors and lawyers is that many software engineers are self-taught to great effect and should not be discounted.  There is also already the fact that those with a degree or other certificate of training are already boosted in the view of employers as they already have that certainty of training unlike those who are self-taught.</p>
<h3>1.9</h3>
<p>1. Engineers should not intentionally hide information on what a software may do such as data collection.</p>
<p>2. Engineers should not put any backdoors or such in a system they are working on to later use themselves against a client.</p>
<p>3.  Engineers should ensure the security of a system such that hackers could not take advantage of it.</p>
<p>4. Engineers should not leak any confidential data for their own gain or the express intent of hurting the client.</p>
<p>5.  Managers should abstain from unjust work practices such as intense crunch time to finish a product.</p>
<p>6.  Engineers should act in a way that does not make the profession seem completely immoral such as working for an immoral employer.</p>
<p>7.  Engineers should not blame mistakes on colleagues unjustly to get ahead.</p>
<p>8.  Engineers should always be learning such to improve their work and get ahead of new security threats and the like.</p>
<h3>1.10</h3>
<p>The ethics involved in the creation of a system to constantly track citizens is essentially none.  The excuse of “fighting terrorism” can be used to drastically increase control over people and their daily lives.  Even if the morals of the users are completely just, the possibility of a malicious user is more than enough reason to not create a system that can be taken advantage of to a drastic degree. </p>
